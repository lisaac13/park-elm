<h2>Exercising Your Rights to Know or Delete</h2>

<p>To exercise your rights to know or delete described above, please submit a request by:</p>

<ul><li>Emailing us at info@parkelmcenturyplaza.com</li></ul>

<p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request to know or delete related to your personal information.</p>

<p>You may also make a request to know or delete on behalf of your child. You may only submit a request to know twice within a 12-month period. Your request to know or delete must:</p>

<ul><li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include providing two specific pieces of personal information including recently purchased items, the dollar amounts of purchases, etc. For a minor, you will be asked to sign a consent form, and may be required to produce government-issued identification.</li>

<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li></ul>

<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.</p>

<p>You do not need to create an account with us to submit a request to know or delete. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.</p>

<p>We will only use personal information provided in the request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make it.</p>

<p>For instructions on exercising your sale opt-out or opt-in rights, see Section 4 below.</p>

<h2>Response Timing and Format</h2>

<p>We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please contact info@parkelmcenturyplaza.com.</p>

<p>If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>

<p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>

<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>

Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.</p>

<p>To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by emailing us at info@parkelmcenturyplaza.com.</p>

<p>Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by emailing us at info@parkelmcenturyplaza.com.</p>

<p>You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.</p>
